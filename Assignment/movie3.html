<h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Ramkishan Chaturvedi, a rich businessman married a simpleton Mamta Awasthi, after his first wife died leaving him with the 1 year-old Vivek, who also accepted and respects Mamta as his own mother. Later Ramkishan and Mamta have three kids: Prem, Sangeeta and Vinod. Some years earlier while trying to save Vinod in an about to happen accident, Vivek is injured and his right hand is paralyzed.<br /><br />

    Back to present, Prem returns from United States after completing his studies and is set to marry his love interest Preeti—daughter of Ramkishan's friend Pritam Shukla. Sangita is married to Anand Tiwari and has a daughter Radhika. Vinod is too engaged to marry his love interest Sapna—daughter of Ramkishan's village neighbor Dharamraj Bajpai. Vivek is still receiving treatment for his hand's repair.<br /><br />

    After Ramkishan and Mamta's 25th anniversary celebration, his business associate Adarsh Sharma lends a marriage proposal for Vivek to marry his daughter Sadhna. Scared at first due to his hand, Vivek later agrees and marries Sadhna. Soon Mamta's three friends and Dharamraj fill her head with thoughts as to why Vivek should not be in charge of the family inheritance. This causes Mamta to feel scared about what will happen.<br /><br />

    A bitter turn comes when Anand's elder brother Anurag cheats on him from inheritance and share in the family business. This makes Mamta very paranoid and question Ramkishan's decision to make Vivek the head of their family business. She demands that Ramkishan divide the business equally between all sons instead of putting Vivek in charge. Ramkishan disagrees thinking it will divide the family.<br /><br />

    Heartbroken after finding out the conversation, Vivek instead decides to choose defusion by telling Mamta that he will move back to their ancestral village Rampur to take care of the new factory recently set up. He asks Ramkishan to put Prem in charge of the family empire and Sadhna supports him. They move to Rampur and Vinod accompanies them.<br /><br />

    Upon returning from USA, Prem refuses to replace Vivek as head of the family. Vivek convinces him to go along with the plan in the interest of preventing further conflict within the family. Prem confronts Mamta and tells her that he will not marry if she wants him to replace Vivek. Eventually, Anurag realizes he made a huge mistake in cheating Anand and breaking up his family.<br /><br />

    Sangita asks Mamta to bring back Vivek in the house. Mamta realizes her mistakes and visits Rampur along with Ramkishan. In hospital Sadhna delivers a baby boy. Prem marries Preeti and Vinod marries Sapna. Dharamraj apologises realising that manners cannot separate the love in family. Everyone lives happily ever after.</p>
